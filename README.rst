### Molecular modelling based on principles of Langevin Dynamics.

This package provides a function wherein a particle's motion is described according to the principles of Langevin dynamics. The function models the particle's motion as a result of a stochastic force accounting for molecular interactions, a dampening force accounting for solvent drag, and a force derived from a given potential energy distribution for the system. User inputs include a coefficient for dampening, a given temperature, initial position and velocity. See usage for documentation on how to use function.
